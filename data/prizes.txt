A Physics Nobel Prize laureate is awarded a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[19]
Medals
Main article: Nobel Prize medal ยง Physics and Chemistry
The medal for the Nobel Prize in Physics is identical in design to the Nobel Prize in Chemistry medal.[20][21] The reverse of the physics and chemistry medals depict the Goddess of Nature in the form of Isis as she emerges from clouds holding a cornucopia. The Genius of Science holds the veil which covers Nature's 'cold and austere face'.[21] It was designed by Erik Lindberg and is manufactured by Svenska Medalj in Eskilstuna.[21] It is inscribed "Inventas vitam iuvat excoluisse per artes" ("It is beneficial to have improved (human) life through discovered arts") an adaptation of "inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artes" from line 663 from book 6 of the Aeneid by the Roman poet Virgil.[22] A plate below the figures is inscribed with the name of the recipient. The text "REG. ACAD. SCIENT. SUEC." denoting the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is inscribed on the reverse.[21]
Diplomas

1903 Nobel Prize diploma, awarded to Marie Curie and Pierre Curie
Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate who receives it.[23] The diploma contains a picture with the name of the laureate and a citation explaining their accomplishments.[23]
Award money
At the awards ceremony, the laureate is given a document indicating the award sum. The amount of the cash award may differ from year to year, based on the funding available from the Nobel Foundation. For example, in 2009 the total cash awarded was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million),[24] but in 2012 following the Great Recession, the amount was 8 million Swedish Kronor, or US$1.1 million.[25] If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients, but if there are three, the awarding committee may opt to divide the grant equally, or award half to one recipient and a quarter to each of the two others.[26][27][28][29]
Ceremony
The committee and institution serving as the selection board for the prize typically announce the names of the laureates during the first week of October. The prize is then awarded at formal ceremonies held annually in Stockholm Concert Hall on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The laureates receive a diploma, a medal and a document confirming the prize amount.[30]
